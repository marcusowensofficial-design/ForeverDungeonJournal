# Quest clarity plan (ForeverDungeonJournal)

Goal: every quest and chain step says where it starts, where the objective is and where it is turned in, with a map button for each. Updated 2026-11-11.

## Done

- **An Unholy Alliance**: both parts explain the full chain; Varimathras has map buttons (56.2, 92.6); part 2 has a **Find Ambassador Malcin** button with his main spawn and four alternates. The quest tracker points at Malcin until you have the head, then at Varimathras.
- **Chain bar** under chain quests ("Quest chain: N steps first – click to show"); the chain opens the first time the quest is picked; steps show `>` and a tooltip.
- **"Find <NPC>" button** (`objectiveMap`) on chain steps and main quest pages.
- **Step map buttons from data the addon already had** (QuestUpdates.lua, BEGIN stepmaps): exact, unambiguous NPC-name matches only.
- **`Data/QuestLocations.lua`**: start / turn-in / objective spots from the map data on Wowhead Forever quest pages (Forever spawns) for **567 of the journal's 567** quests and steps. Fills gaps only, never overwrites hand-placed spots. Adds a "Where to go:" list with coordinates to quests that had no notes. Rebuild with `python tools/build_quest_locations.py` after adding pages to `tools/wowhead_quest_spots.json`.
- **Spot corrections** (`FDJ.NPC_SPOT_CORRECTIONS` in QuestLocations.lua), each verified against Wowhead Forever:
  - Tirion Fordring → his hut, 7.6, 43.6 (was 4.3, 36.1 on 7 Argent Dawn steps)
  - Nathanos Blightcaller → Marris Stead, 26.6, 74.8 (was 22.2, 64.3)
  - Haleh → deep in Mazthoril, 54.4, 51.2 (a 57.4, 67.2 copy was wrong)
  - Duke Nicholas Zverenhoff → Light's Hope, 81.4, 59.8 (was 73.7, 50.8)
  - High Explorer Magellas → Hall of Explorers, 69.6, 18.6 (a 77.2, 11.8 copy was wrong)
  - Eastern Plaguelands group that was about 8 points off: Betina Bigglezink, Leonid Barthalomew, Smokey LaRue, Caretaker Alen (Light's Hope), Aurora Skycaller (Northpass Tower), Egan
- Chain steps without a turn-in button: 271 → 16.

## Rules

- Coordinates come from Wowhead Forever (page map data or comments), the Wayback Machine's copies of those pages, or an in-game `/loc`; never guessed.
- **Stormwind is never taken from Wowhead**: Forever's Stormwind map does not line up with Wowhead's (classic) Stormwind coordinates. Stormwind spots need an in-game `/loc`.
- Fetch Wowhead slowly (one page every few seconds, back off for minutes on any 403/429); bulk fetching gets the IP blocked.
- Text format for pickup/turn-in: `NPC, sub-area, zone (x, y)`. NPC name first so the auto-fill can match it.
- When English text changes, clear the translated field so no locale shows the old wording (see the Unholy Alliance block).

## Left to do

### 1. Check in game (`/loc`)

Settled 12 Nov 2026 (Wowhead Forever):
- Archmage Tervosh: 66.0, 49.0, Theramore mage tower (Data/QuestMaps.lua).
- Baros Alexston: 57.6, 47.8, City Hall next to the Argent Dawn building. 49.0, 30.2 is the fallback if he isn't there. Confirm in game which one is right.

Still to check:

- Alba Fairmoon (quest 92753): journal Sentinel Hill inn 52.6, 53.8 vs Wowhead 38.6, 83.6 (Westfall). She may move during her quests.
- Thom Filch (quest 96403): journal 43.5, 52.0 (Hall of Thanes portal) vs Wowhead 32.4, 44.8 (Ironforge).
- Lakeshire: Wiley the Black, Guard Berton and Dorin Songblade are all about 5 points west of Wowhead's spots (journal ~21.3 vs Wowhead ~26.5). Wowhead also lists a Wiley spawn at 21.4, 45.2, so this may be phasing rather than an error.
- Small differences worth a glance: Hammertoe Grez (Badlands, 44.3, 12.0 vs 37.9, 10.6), Scout Galiaan (Westfall).

### 2. Chain steps still without a turn-in button

Rechecked 12 Nov 2026. Most rows in the old table are covered now:
- 373, 94890, 94973, 94980: Wowhead Forever turn-in spots (Data/QuestLocations.lua).
- 5122 Aurius and 95647 Ardin Grassman: `turnins` pins on the Stratholme and Excavation Site maps.
- 5722 Maur Grimtotem: `turninMap` points at the corpse spot on the Ragefire Chasm map.

Still missing. Neither Wowhead Forever nor Wowhead Classic gives coordinates inside these dungeons, so each one needs a `/loc` reading in game:

| Step | Turn-in | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| 4241, 4264, 4282 | Marshal Windsor (Detention Block) | `DUNGEON_MAPS["Blackrock Depths"].turnins`, floor 1 |
| 4341, 4342 | Kharan Mighthammer (Detention Block) | same |
| 4742 | Vaelan (Scarshield Infiltrator), LBRS | an LBRS map first |
| 4981, 5001 | Bijou, LBRS | an LBRS map first |
| 7643 | Ancient Equine Spirit, Dire Maul | `DUNGEON_MAPS["Dire Maul: East"]` or West, after finding which wing |

### Vague chain steps (short objective, no description yet)

Most of these are done inside a dungeon, so Wowhead has no world coordinates for them. They need a hand-written line on where in the dungeon.
